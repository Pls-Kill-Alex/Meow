He/she/it, Asian. infp ♊

I'm old enough to smoke and drink. ⌯ᐢᗜᐢ⌯ಣ

Some of the basics:

●I even seem to be playing Pony town illegaly（（

●I really want to be a supporter for my skin!! But I can't use Patreon... > <

--About me--

1.DNI:

◆we cant be friends If you've visited Yasukuni and support Unit 731◆

●I don't like people who deny history-

●I don't like racists-

●I don't like 《My Hero Academia》so please don't talk to me about how much you like it，and don't use cos skins in front of me-

●I don't like people who are rude to me before they become friends-

●I don't like the emoji '😅'-


2. About friends:

   ◆I don't want to be boring, but I can't understand a lot of memes because I can't use tiktok. Sorry for that.

I like to joke. I joke with you because I think you're a friend. But if my joke hurt to you, tell me!◆

♡All I'm doing is trying to make my friends happy, I'd rather we have a relationship going both ways, not that I'm just your clown, and I'd really slap you for it.♡

Forgive me if I have no reason to be away from society for a while, I just don't want my emotions to hurt my friends

I like to cling to my friends. I like hug and rub. If you're upset, I'll be a master of doughnuts.（Knead，rub, hug）
Because i can't use discord and tele, if you want to contact me, you need to download the software that can contact me. Sorry for the trouble,so I thank my friends for this!!!

I'm not friends with mutes... but I'm sorry I'm mute myself a lot of times👉👈

♡My friends saved my life. I love them very much. I really appreciate everything.♡


3. About myself:

 I find it awkward for my friends to see me introduce myself bth 👉👈

most of time i with my friends afk and making skins, sorry for if i didnt saw interaction, not because am rude.

I like horror stories and games,i play Sally Face,Manny's,IDV,CSGO,CF,Onmyoji,MC


I'm actually a very dark person irl.

♡I have a lot of negative energy, and if I tell you about me, it's because I trust you and I want to be close with  you, not because I want to get sympathy or use you as an emotional garbage can... no one wants to tear their scars open for someone to see. But if you mind that, you can tell me.♡

I'm happy that my friends vent their negative feelings to me. I really want to help my friends, but I'm not very good at comforting people. Maybe I don't seem to care, but it's not like that!!

So , in general, what I've konw about myself so far is that i have moderate bipolar disorder and mild somatization, and most of the time I'm very happy and excited, but sometimes there's a period of depression, and if I looks like careful with you, don't worry, it's not your fault. If that happens, I'll only have the strength to interact with my friends

I'm working hard to make money for the psychiatrist... please don't say any hurtful things about these 😥orz

I always like to talk nonsense, like this↑ lmaoo

That's all I'm up for givin y'all, hope your curiosity's been sated⌯>ᴗo⌯ಣ
