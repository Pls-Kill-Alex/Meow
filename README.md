--About me--

1.DNI:

I don't like people who deny history-
I don't like racists-
I don't like 《My Hero Academia》so please don't talk to me about how much you like it，and don't use cos skins in front of me-
I don't like people who are rude to me before they become friends-
I don't like the emoji '😅'-

2. About friends:
I don't want to be boring, but I can't understand a lot of memes because I can't use tiktok. Sorry for that.
I like to joke. I joke with you because I think you're a friend. But if my joke hurt to you, tell me!

All I'm doing is trying to make my friends happy, I'd rather we have a relationship going both ways, not that I'm just your clown, and I'd really slap you for it.

I like to cling to my friends. I like hug and rub. If you're upset, I'll be a master of doughnuts.（Knead，rub, hug）
Because i can't use discord and tele, if you want to contact me, you need to download the software that can contact me. Sorry for the trouble,so I thank my friends for this
I often say "I love you" to my friends in a joking way. I really love my friends. I'm just shy and not good at saying sentimental things

I'm not friends with mutes... but I'm sorry I'm mute myself a lot of times!!!!
My friends saved my life. I love them very much. I really appreciate everything.

3. About myself:

I respect any group

I only release this tag when I'm alone because I find it awkward for my friends to see me introduce myself。XD

most of my time with my friends afk and making skins, if i didnt saw interaction, not because am rude

I'm actually a very dark person,

I have a lot of negative energy, and if I tell you about me, it's because I trust you and I want to be close with  you, not because I want to get sympathy or use you as an emotional garbage can... no one wants to tear their scars open for someone to see. But if you mind that, you can tell me.

I'm happy that my friends vent their negative feelings to me. I really want to help my friends, but I'm not very good at comforting people. Maybe I don't seem to care, but it's not like that!!

So, in general, what I've learned about myself so far is that I'm bipolar and somatized, and most of the time I'm very excited, but sometimes there's a period of depression, and I might be careful with you, don't worry, it's not your fault. If that happens, I'll only have the strength to interact with my friends
I'm working hard to make money for the psychiatrist... please don't say anything about these hurtful things orz

I always like to talk nonsense, like this↑ lmaoo

That's all I'm up for givin y'all, hope your curiosity's been sated^^
